## Initial Findings

Preliminary experiments using Vision–Language Models suggest that satellite images
showing visible industrial activity and emissions are more strongly aligned with
claims describing active gas flaring than with generalized sustainability commitments.

These results do not constitute an audit or evaluation of any specific organization.
Rather, they demonstrate the potential of multimodal AI approaches to complement
text-based sustainability assessments by incorporating objective visual evidence.
